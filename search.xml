    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Han Li slowly followed the path from the God Hand Valley out of force of habit. His steps automatically carried him towards the Crimson Water Peak. He did not have anything important to do at the moment, and as such, he followed his normal schedule and visited Zhang Tie, who was training at the Crimson Water Peak. Zhang Tie grimaced1 in pain, allowing the impact of the waterfall to temper2 his body as he cultivated the Way of the Armored Elephant. Not everyone could withstand the torturous3 pain from cultivating this particular martial arts. Even the first layer already required one to suffer excruciating4 pain. To reach the ninth layer, wouldn’t it require one to cultivate to the point of insanity5, losing their skin in the process? “Hmm, I wonder if Zhang Tie already regrets6 his previous decision. The excruciating torture one had to endure7 to practice the Way of the Armored Elephant is impossible to imagine,” Han Li thought as he walked, carelessly kicking8 the fallen leaves and branches that were blocking his way. “Maybe after a few more days, the two of us will go and beg Doctor Mo for another martial arts skill for Zhang Tie so that he won’t need to suffer from excruciating pain each time he practices.” Having absorbed himself in thought trying to think of methods to allow Zhang Tie to escape from this torturous path of practice, Han Li slowly roused himself to look at his surroundings. Han Li tilted9 his head as he gazed at the line of trees by his side. Currently, the year was approaching the late stages of autumn. The trees’ branches were all naked10 and devoid11 of leaves. Piles of sticks12 and dead leaves layered13 the small paths. Walking on them felt like walking on cotton. Han Li found this experience extremely comfortable. In that moment, the sounds of weapons clashing14 drifted over from15 a nearby mountain peak, as well as the many loud cheers. After hearing the noises, Han Li glanced in the direction of the mountain peak, annoyed that his good mood had been disturbed. The noise came from disciples of the Hundred Forge Division. They were training the disciples selected to join their division in the various arts of weaponry. Everytime Han Li saw other sect members gathering16 and undergoing17 their training sessions18, slight hints of jealousy surfaced in his heart. He wanted to wield19 a real weapon and demonstrate20 his skills as well. What a waste! After he officially became a disciple under Doctor Mo, he had been strongly forbidden from practicing such things. Doctor Mo strongly emphasized that Han Li was to devote all of his time to the nameless oracular chant. Therefore, Han Li could only stare with wide and envious21 eyes. Occasionally, to scratch his itch22, he would borrow a few weapons from some of the other sect members he was on good terms with23 and practice with them. How truly useful was it to cultivate the mysterious chant? Up until now, Han Li had not seen any positive effects of his constant24 cultivation. Other disciples had already strengthened their body and mastered impressive martial art techniques. If the path of martial arts was compared to a marathon, Han Li was certain that he had remained at the starting point and hadn’t advanced in the least. Even Zhang Tie, who had cultivated for two months, had some beneficial changes to show for his efforts. His skin and muscles had become tougher, and his level of strength was also noticeably higher than before. However, if Doctor Mo had not accepted Zhang Tie as an Unofficial Disciple, he would not have passed the Unofficial Disciple Test two months ago. If he had not passed the test, then staying on the mountain would be impossible, let alone sending money back home! If Zhang Tie was unable to cultivate another branch of martial arts, his path would be forever sealed. On one hand, Han Li was grumbling25 about the unfairness of their situation. On the other hand, he was reassuring26 himself that since he passed Doctor Mo’s test, he would not be kicked out of the Seven Mysteries Sect. Han Li retracted his gaze from the other sect members, but he continued to think about Doctor Mo’s irritating27 commands. Distracted28 and in low spirits, he gazed at the two lines of trees alongside the road as pangs29 of dejection struck30 him. All of a sudden, Han Li sucked in a mouthful of cool air, his facial expression turning ugly. Out of reflex, he squatted31 down and used both his hands to tightly clamp32 on the big toe33 of his right foot, doubling over in the grass. A sudden, painful flare-up34 had caught Han Li unaware. His face became a pale35 white as waves of fiery pain assailed36 his right foot. Evidently, Han Li had accidentally kicked against an extremely hard object hidden in the piles37 of leaves. Han Li arched38 his body and used both of his hands to wrap39 around his foot. After he lowered his head and removed his shoes, he began to blow40 heavily on his injured toe; while his brain flooded with pain, he was worried that his swollen41 toe might have been injured to an extent that would impact his day-to-day activities After a long moment, Han Li craned42 his neck and peered43 downwards to that pile of leaves, trying to find the ungodly44, dastardly45 stone that caused him to be injured. Haphazardly lying about, the fallen leaves were all the same reddish46-yellow color. They obscured47 him from finding the target he sought. Han Li wrinkled48 his forehead and surveyed the ground before finding a slightly long and thick tree branch. Holding the branch, he stood up carefully. Unwilling to give up, Han Li used the branch in his hands and continued to probe49 piles of leaves. Ai! He spotted an object the size of a fist. Han Li paused momentarily50 and considered the object in front of him. The culprit51, the sinful52 object that caused injury to his great self, actually had the shape of an elongated53 bottle. The surface of it was stained54 with mud, and its original color was impossible to discern55. Overall56, it looked extremely commonplace. Initially, Han Li thought that this was an ordinary little bottle, but in his hands, the bottle was extraordinary heavy, its weight vastly different from that of a normal porcelain57 bottle. Could this bottle be made of gold? No wonder it caused so much pain when he kicked it. but.. bottles made of gold were rarely seen… Made of gold….? Han Li’s interest in this bottle peaked58 as he temporarily forgot about the waves of pain arising from his toe. As Han Li wiped off the excess59 layer of mud, the original color of the bottle began to unveil60 itself. The bottle emanated61 a shiny green glow, and there were intricate62 black green leaf patterns63 engraved64 on its surface. At the head of the bottle, there was a bottle cap that tightly sealed65 the mouth of the bottle. Hmm, could the interior66 be hiding something precious? Han Li placed the bottle close to his ear and gently shook the bottle, but he didn’t feel any movements from the inside of the bottle. Unwilling to give up, Han Li placed his hands on the cap of the bottle and tried to pry it open67. However, no matter how hard he tried, it was to no avail68. Curiosity was burning in his heart, and just when he was about to use another method to open it, the pain from his foot suddenly flared up again. Damn! He had forgotten that the toe of his right leg had been injured after coming into contact with the porcelain bottle. Looking at his injury, it seemed he could not visit Zhang Tie today. Han Li decided to return to his residence and apply some medicine on his injured toe before taking his time to figure out the secrets this mysterious bottle was holding. In order to keep the bottle from being spotted by others, Han Li stashed69 it inside his robes regardless of how dirty the bottle was. Turning back70, he limped step by step back to his home. 1. 因痛苦、厌恶等) 做鬼脸 &#8617; 2. 使(金属)回火; &#8617; 3. 折磨人的; &#8617; 4. 极痛苦的; &#8617; 5. 精神错乱; &#8617; 6. 懊悔; &#8617; 7. 忍耐; 忍受 &#8617; 8. 踢; 踹; 踢蹬 &#8617; 9. 倾斜 &#8617; 10. 裸体的; 裸露的; &#8617; 11. 完全没有; 缺乏; &#8617; 12. 枝条; &#8617; 13. 把…分层堆放; &#8617; 14. 打斗; 冲突; &#8617; 15. 从…漂过来 &#8617; 16. 集会 &#8617; 17. 经历，经受 &#8617; 18. 会议 &#8617; 19. 拥有 &#8617; 20. 表达; 表露 &#8617; 21. 羡慕的; 忌妒的; &#8617; 22. 抓挠他的痒 &#8617; 23. 与…保持良好关系 &#8617; 24. 不断的; &#8617; 25. 发牢骚; &#8617; 26. 使…安心 &#8617; 27. 恼人的; &#8617; 28. 注意力分散的; &#8617; 29. 突然的疼痛 &#8617; 30. 撞; 碰; &#8617; 31. 蹲坐; 蹲 &#8617; 32. 夹紧 &#8617; 33. 脚趾 &#8617; 34. 爆发; 突发 &#8617; 35. 灰白的; 苍白的; &#8617; 36. 攻击; 抨击; &#8617; 37. 堆放; 摞起; &#8617; 38. 成弓形; &#8617; 39. 包，裹 &#8617; 40. 吹; &#8617; 41. 肿胀的 &#8617; 42. 探着身子 &#8617; 43. 仔细看; 端详; &#8617; 44. 邪恶的; &#8617; 45. 邪恶残忍的 &#8617; 46. 微红的; &#8617; 47. 使费解; &#8617; 48. 起皱纹; &#8617; 49. 探查，查看; &#8617; 50. 立即; 马上; &#8617; 51. 罪犯 &#8617; 52. 不道德的; 邪恶的; &#8617; 53. 细长的; &#8617; 54. 玷污; 留下污渍 &#8617; 55. 看出，分辨出 &#8617; 56. 大致上; 总体上; &#8617; 57. 普通的; 普遍的; &#8617; 58. 达到高峰; 达到最高值; &#8617; 59. 附加的; &#8617; 60. 揭开…上的覆盖物 &#8617; 61. 产生; 表现; 显示 &#8617; 62. 错综复杂的; &#8617; 63. 图案; 花样; 式样 &#8617; 64. 在…上雕刻 &#8617; 65. 封上 &#8617; 66. 内部; &#8617; 67. 撬开它 &#8617; 68. 效用; &#8617; 69. 存放; 贮藏; 隐藏; &#8617; 70. 折回 &#8617;]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Looking back, Han Li couldn’t help but give a knowing1 smile. In the half year that Han Li spent with Zhang Tie, because their personalities2 matched well with each other, the two had naturally become very close friends. Han Li slowly stood from his crossed-legged3 position and rubbed4 his calves5. After sitting in the cross-legged position and meditating for a long time, his legs had become numb, and even some of his bloodstreams felt clogged6. After kneading7 them for some time, his legs returned back to their normal state. Standing up, Han Li dusted8 himself in his usual custom before exiting the stone chamber. Turning his head back to look at the stone chamber used for cultivation, Han Li couldn’t help but sneer9 at himself. This entire chamber was made of solid granite10 while the doors were made of a giant piece of crocidolite. If a normal human wanted to break into this room, he or she would need to spend at least three hours hacking11 at the doors with an enormous axe. (TL: crocidolite: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riebeckite) In the Seven Mysteries Sect, only the Sect Leader, Elders, and Division Heads were allowed to use this type of silent cultivation chamber. Not even12 Inner Disciples were allowed to use them as they pleased! This cultivation chamber was created for those practicing profound13 cultivation techniques to guard14 their practice against any external disruption15 and in order to prevent qigong deviation16. Han Li didn’t know what methods Doctor Mo had used, but the Sect somehow granted him the usage of his own personal cultivation stone chamber, built into the side of the cliff of the God Hand Valley. (TL: Qigong deviation) is when cultivation goes awry.) After the cultivation chamber was built, Doctor Mo had assigned it for Han Li’s sole use. Seeing such a gift, Han Li couldn’t help but feel humbled17 by Doctor Mo’s benevolence18. Doctor Mo’s treatment of Han Li was perhaps too good to be true. Ever since Han Li had become his official apprentice, Doctor Mo had personally dipped into his own supply of herbs for Han Li to consume. Not only that, Doctor Mo also created an unknown medicinal bath for him to soak his body in. Han Li didn’t know what types of herbs were being used, but as he watched Doctor carefully refine those herbs, his normally impassive face revealed19 a hint of reluctance20. Even Han Li could figure out21 that these herbs were extremely valuable. Clearly, these benefits were extremely useful to him, causing Han Li’s cultivation speed to increase severalfold22. Han Li had recently succeeded in mastering the first layer of the mysterious formula chant imparted to him by Doctor Mo. During his process of breaking through, his meridians had nearly ruptured several times and he had suffered from some moderate23 internal injuries. But thanks to Doctor Mo’s expertise in the healing arts, the injuries to his meridians were easily repaired, and with the aid of the medicinal herbs, Han Li did not suffer from any serious, permanent24 damage. Every time Han Li was even slightly injured, Doctor Mo would become even more worried than Han Li himself. This worry manifested25 itself the entire time he treated Han Li, making Doctor Mo very tense. It was only when Han Li’s injuries began recovering that he let out a sigh of relief. Doctor Mo’s concern went far beyond that of a normal relationship between master and disciple and caused Han Li to feel a little uneasy about the situation. If it were not for his Third Uncle or the fact that no one ever walked out from these valleys, Han Li would have thought that Doctor Mo was actually his long lost relative based on the attention that he had been showing to Han Li. (TL: the author did not make it clear how Han Li’s Third Uncle prevented him from thinking this) Walking out of the cultivation chamber, Han Li lazily stretched26 his body and walked away from the cliff. After he had become an official disciple, Han Li and Zhang Tie moved from their original quarters27 into their own personal house. As he passed by Zhang Tie’s room, Han Li shot a glance inside. As it turns out, Zhang Tie wasn’t inside. Han Li thought that he was probably by the Crimson Water Peak’s waterfall, cultivating his new martial arts technique. After the examination, Doctor Mo instructed Han Li to continue practicing the oracular formula chant and refused to teach him any martial arts. However, in an attempt to pacify28 Han Li, Doctor Mo personally instructed Han Li in the art of healing without holding anything back29. Whenever Han Li had a question about medicine, Doctor Mo would answer right away, even going as far as allowing Han Li to look through the various books in Doctor Mo’s library to find an answer to his question. As for Zhang Tie, Doctor Mo fulfilled30 his previous promise and imparted a set of martial arts to him. The martial arts Zhang Tie practiced was extremely peculiar31. According to Doctor Mo, it was an extremely obscure32 branch of martial arts named the “Way of the Armored Elephant”. Even the name of this particular martial art was rarely heard of, let alone the existence of practitioners who actually cultivated it. It differed from the martial arts of regular practitioners in Jiang Hu. Generally, the progression of cultivation for normal martial arts ranged from easy to difficult. As the level increased, so would the difficulty. Thus, the higher the level, the more effort it would take for one to achieve a breakthrough. Zhang Tie’s particular martial art style was divided into nine layers, with the initial three layers being the easiest to cultivate, following the same principle as normal martial arts. However, starting from the fourth layer, the difficulty of breaking through was increased to a monstrous33 level in addition to suffering the excruciating34 backlash caused by practicing the Way of the Armored Elephant. Many cultivators of this set of martial arts could not bear such excruciating pain and would stop their progression at the fourth level. Not to mention the 5th level nor the 6th level, the excruciating pain would only increase with each level! (TL: Jiang Hu= World of Martial Artists) After breaking through from the sixth layer into the seventh, there would be no further bottlenecks35, and cultivation would be much smoother. The only drawback36 was that the cultivator would need to suffer from monthly bouts37 of intense38 pain. This intimidated39 many people who desired to cultivate the Way of the Armored Elephant. This particular branch of martial arts was slowly dying out. This martial arts style was very peculiar. When it reached a high enough level, its strength would become truly astounding40. It was said that those who reached the ninth layer had bodies as tough as gemstones41. They were impervious42 to all weapons, even fire and water! Even palms strike43, fist techniques, and legendary swords and sabers wouldn’t be able to injure them. But what made people most envious44 was that after cultivating this branch of martial art, practitioners would gain the tremendous45 strength of an elephant. After reaching a high enough level, their strength would be limitless. They were capable of catching live wolves and ripping46 tigers apart, as well as other unparalleled47 feats48. Those who had heard of this style both feared and adored it. Other than the creator of this martial art, there was no other individual49 who had managed to cultivate it to the ninth layer. Legend has it that the creator of this martial art was born without the sense of pain! That was the reason why he was able to create such a perverse50 martial art and execute it to its greatest potential51. Although Doctor Mo had explained the benefits and consequences52 in its entirety to Zhang Tie, Zhang Tie had no concerns about the harm it could bring to his body. He coveted53 the strength the Way of the Armored Elephant could bring him and promised right away to cultivate in this style of martial arts. Without even looking for another style suitable to him, Zhang Tie had already reached the peak of the first layer in two months. In order to break through the first layer of the Way of the Armored Elephant, Doctor Mo had suggested that every afternoon, Zhang Tie should go to the Crimson Water Peak’s waterfall and cultivate under the impact of the surging54 waters. According to Zhang Tie, this method really did have a godly effect. The difference between the peak of the first layer to the second layer was only paper thin55, and as long as he worked a little harder, he would break through the bottleneck with relative ease56! 1. 会意的; 心照不宣的 &#8617; 2. 性格 &#8617; 3. 盘着腿的, 翘着腿的 &#8617; 4. 擦; 磨; 搓 &#8617; 5. 小腿肚 &#8617; 6. 阻塞，堵塞 &#8617; 7. 揉，捏 &#8617; 8. 擦灰; 掸去; &#8617; 9. 嘲笑; 讥讽; 嗤笑 &#8617; 10. 花岗岩; 花岗石 &#8617; 11. 砍; 劈; &#8617; 12. 甚至不 &#8617; 13. 玄奥的; &#8617; 14. 守卫; 保卫 &#8617; 15. 中断; 扰乱; &#8617; 16. 偏差; &#8617; 17. 使感到卑微; &#8617; 18. 仁爱; 善行; &#8617; 19. 显示; &#8617; 20. 不情愿; &#8617; 21. 理解; &#8617; 22. 几倍地; &#8617; 23. 不激烈的; 不偏激的 &#8617; 24. 长久的; &#8617; 25. 表明 &#8617; 26. 伸了伸懒腰 &#8617; 27. 住处 &#8617; 28. 抚慰; &#8617; 29. 没有丝毫保留 &#8617; 30. 实现; 履行; &#8617; 31. 怪异的; 奇怪的; 不寻常的; &#8617; 32. 鲜为人知的; &#8617; 33. 骇人的; &#8617; 34. 极痛苦的; &#8617; 35. 瓶颈，障碍 &#8617; 36. 缺点; 不利条件; &#8617; 37. 一阵 &#8617; 38. 十分强烈的; &#8617; 39. 恐吓; 威胁; &#8617; 40. 令人震惊的; 使大吃一惊的 &#8617; 41. 宝石; &#8617; 42. 不受影响的; &#8617; 43. 手掌打击 &#8617; 44. 羡慕的; 忌妒的; &#8617; 45. 巨大的; &#8617; 46. 撕破，裂开 &#8617; 47. 无比的; 无双的; &#8617; 48. 技艺; 武艺; &#8617; 49. 个人 &#8617; 50. 不通情理的; &#8617; 51. 潜力; &#8617; 52. 后果; &#8617; 53. 渴望; &#8617; 54. 涌; 汹涌; 涌动; &#8617; 55. 薄如纸的; &#8617; 56. 相对容易 &#8617;]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[After half a year of relentless1 cultivation, Han Li was finally going to take Doctor Mo’s test. Zhang Tie was fidgeting2 as he stood close to Han Li. His behavior was nothing strange. Zhang Tie had told Han Li that for the past six months, he had made no progress on the oracular chant given to them by Doctor Mo. Han Li knew that Zhang Tie’s efforts in cultivating the oracular chant were no less intense3 than his own. Although Zhang Tie was unlike Han Li, who practiced like a madman, the efforts he expended4 could still be considered conscientious5 and diligent6! Strangely, the oracular chant seemed to be useless to Zhang Tie. No matter how much effort he put in, he wasn’t able to produce even the slightest amount of effects. It seems like Zhang Tie would never successfully cultivate the oracular chant. Han Li’s mind was unsettled. He knew that Zhang Tie would probably fail the test. Even though Han Li was slightly successful in learning the oracular chant, he was not stronger than Zhang Tie in any way, so there was a high chance of both of them failing Doctor Mo’s test. Fearing the worst, Han Li assiduously cultivated. By the time of the exam, the strange energy flowing in his body had increased by a little. If the energy was as thin as a strand of hair in the past, it was now slightly thicker7, resembling8 a thread of cotton9. Even so, this did not reassure10 Han Li, who feared he might not pass Doctor Mo’s test. “Are you guys prepared? Let me take a look at the fruits of your cultivation.” Doctor Mo squinted11 his eyes as he sat and coldly stared at the two of them. “We are ready!” Han Li and Zhang Tie could only put forth a bold face12 and agree. Doctor Mo, slowly rose from his chair and stood up. He put the book that always seemed to be nearby down on the table. “Extend your hand” “Circulate your Qi for me to see.” Doctor Mo held Zhang Tie’s right wrist with one hand and placed his other hand on top of Zhang Tie’s Dantian. After the time it took to brew13 a cup of tea, Doctor Mo retracted14 his hands and closely evaluated Zhang Tie. Zhang Tie’s face was flushed15 as he nervously put his hands behind his back, lowering his head and not daring to look Doctor Mo in the eye. He knew Doctor Mo had most certainly discovered that he made no progress in the oracular chant and would probably punish him to teach the two of them a lesson. “It’s your turn.” To their surprise, Doctor Mo didn’t even show the slightest indication that he would punish Zhang Tie. Some slight hints of disappointment flashing past Doctor Mo’s eyes were the only reactions Doctor Mo had. After examining Zhang Tie, he turned to Han Li and motioned16 for him to come closer. He then held Han Li’s wrist and began the inspection17s. “His touch feels just like ice. It doesn’t feel like the touch of a living human,” Han Li mused in his mind. The skin on Doctor Mo’s hand was dried18 and full of calluses19. As he held Han Li’s hand, Han Li could feel slight waves of sharp pain. Perhaps it was because the external interference20 agitated21 the energy within Han Li’s body, but the strange flow of energy actually started to circulate by itself. It flowed through his meridians and energy channels, passed all his acupoints22 from his Dantian to his head, and flowed to his four limbs. It completed a full cycle before flowing back to his Dantian. The moment the strange flow of energy circulated throughout his entire body, Han Li’s pain from Doctor Mo’s touch immediately dissipated23. “Ai!” Doctor Mo involuntarily24 let out a sound of surprise; it appeared that he had discovered the strange flow of energy in Han Li’s body. “Quick, circulate your energy according to that chant that I taught you once again.” Although Doctor Mo tried his best to suppressed25 his elation26, traces of madness and excitement still flashed through his eyes, causing Han Li to be secretly alarmed. “Slowly, slowly…let me take a good look.” Doctor Mo added as his usually cold tone of voice became rushed, placing his other hand on Han Li’s Dantian. Han Li could feel both of Doctor Mo’s hand tremble27 slightly. As Han Li circulated the strange energy, Doctor Mo became quite agitated. “Not bad! Not bad! This feeling…this is the feeling that I wanted. I’m not wrong, I’m not mistaken! Hahaha!” Doctor Mo, after a thorough examination, could no longer hold back and started laughing maniacally28, both his hands tightly clutched29 on Han Li’s shoulder. Even his normally squinty30 eyes enlarged as they intensely stared at Han Li. It was as if he had seen a rare and valuable treasure, his eyes flashing with faint31 traces of madness. Han Li’s ears were ringing from Doctor Mo’s unceasing32 laughter and he felt slight pain on his shoulder. Seeing the madness in Doctor Mo’s eyes, Han Li could not help but feel terror in his heart. “Good, very good.” From the expression on Han Li’s face, Doctor Mo could tell that he was terrified. Only then did Doctor Mo realize that he had been overeager; thus, he controlled himself and regained his composure33. “In the future, you must work as hard as you’re working right now. From this day onwards, you will be promoted to my personal disciple.” After saying that, Doctor Mo released his tight grip on Han Li’s shoulder and proceeded to pat him in encouragement. Doctor Mo regained his usual calm look almost as if his loss of control had never happened. But from his occasional glances at Han Li, one could tell that he was still tremendously34 excited. “As for you…” Doctor Mo finally shifted his gaze onto Zhang Tie. Zhang Tie was thunderstruck by the events that unfolded earlier. Seeing that Doctor Mo shifted the topic of conversation to him, Zhang Tie awoke from his daze35 with a start36. Just thinking that he failed the assessment and would be asked to leave the mountain caused traces of bitterness37 to appear on Zhang Tie’s face as he looked at Doctor Mo. “Your talent is questionable. Despite such a long period of time, you still could not produce even a small trace of energy. Accepting you as my personal disciple would be too much of a stretch.” Doctor Mo repeatedly shook his head. Zhang Tie’s heart fell down to the bottom of an abyss38 after seeing Doctor Mo shaking39 his head. But suddenly, Doctor Mo seemed to have thought of something interesting, as he gazed at Zhang Tie with a bizarre40 expression in his eyes. “Looking at your bone structure, I may have a suitable technique for you. I just wonder if you are willing to learn from me…” Doctor Mo’s sudden shift in conversation caught everyone by surprise. It was as if Doctor Mo wanted to allow Zhang Tie to pass the test. The moment Zhang Tie heard Doctor Mo, how could he reject the offer? He immediately gave his consent41 and said that he would be willing to learn from Doctor Mo. “Excellent! The two of you can depart first. Tomorrow, I will hand you both new cultivation techniques.” It could be seen that Doctor Mo’s current spirits were excellent! Han Li and Zhang Tie both looked at each other and felt that today’s test had been full of twists and turns42. After all, both of them actually passed, leaving them both satisfied and pleased. 1. 不停的 &#8617; 2. 坐立不安; 烦躁 &#8617; 3. 十分强烈的 &#8617; 4. 花费; &#8617; 5. 勤勉认真的; 一丝不苟的; &#8617; 6. 勤勉的; 刻苦的; &#8617; 7. 厚的; 粗的; &#8617; 8. 看起来像 &#8617; 9. 棉 &#8617; 10. 使…安心; 打消…的疑虑; &#8617; 11. 瞇着眼睛看 &#8617; 12. 硬着头皮 &#8617; 13. 冲泡; 沏; &#8617; 14. 撤销，收回 &#8617; 15. 发红; 脸红 &#8617; 16. 做动作，示意; &#8617; 17. 视察; 检查; &#8617; 18. 干的，脱水的; &#8617; 19. 老茧 &#8617; 20. 干涉; 干预; 介入; (无线电信号的) 干扰 &#8617; 21. 焦虑不安的; 激动的; &#8617; 22. 穴位 &#8617; 23. 消散，消失; &#8617; 24. 非自愿地; &#8617; 25. 控制 &#8617; 26. 兴高采烈; &#8617; 27. 颤抖 &#8617; 28. 疯狂地; &#8617; 29. 抓紧 &#8617; 30. 斜视的 &#8617; 31. 微弱的，不清楚的; 微小的; &#8617; 32. 持续不断的; 连绵不绝的; &#8617; 33. 沉着; 镇静; 镇定 &#8617; 34. 非常地; 极地; &#8617; 35. 恍惚; 迷乱 &#8617; 36. 吃惊; 惊跳 &#8617; 37. 苦味；痛苦 &#8617; 38. 深渊; &#8617; 39. 摇动 &#8617; 40. 极其怪诞的; 异乎寻常的; &#8617; 41. 同意 &#8617; 42. 充满曲折 &#8617;]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[The Difficulties of Cultivating]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F08%2F05%2FC-7%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Han Li slowly transferred energy from his meridians back to his Dantian. He had managed to reach the 7th cycle of Qi circulation today, and Han Li knew that his body had already reached the limit of what it could handle. If he were to try to do another cycle, all his meridians would completely rupture1, inciting a pain worse than death. Even though he was a courageous person, Han Li couldn’t help but break out2 in cold sweat3 at the thought of this pain. It had already been half a year since Han Li joined the sect, and the official Unofficial Disciple exam had ended slightly over two months ago. Only a small portion of the Unofficial Disciples were officially promoted to the Inner Branch. Most Unofficial Disciples weren’t able to pass this point and had no other choice but to pack their belongings and become a disciple of the Outer Branch. The children that didn’t pass would generally enter the Treasure Gathering Division or the Flying Bird Division. For those that showed outstanding performances, they would receive another step further in their training and would then have the chance to join the more respected External Blade Division. Of course, it was only natural that the Four Seas Division was the most respected of the four Divisions, but unfortunately, they only accepted those that made names4 for themselves through their martial arts. If one didn’t have a certain level of expertise in martial arts, it was pointless for them to even dream about joining the Four Seas Division; these immature5 and inexperienced children were even less worthy of any mention6. When Han Li recalled the details of the examination from two months ago, he couldn’t help but feel a bit frightened. A few dozen miles away from the Celestial Rainbow Mountains was a neighboring desolate7 mountain where a group of people were sparring8. There were a few senior disciples who excelled9 in martial arts and were fiercely10 locked in combat11. With each and every test, Han Li couldn’t help but feel a little bit of joy at the misery12 of others. During their entire stay at the Seven Mysteries Sect, Han Li and Zhang Tie had never taken such a terrifying test before. Doctor Mo had said that his examination would only test them on the cultivation chant, but Han Li didn’t believe the test would be as easy as it sounded. Looking back, Han Li could clearly remember the intense13 effort he had to put into his cultivation. According to Doctor Mo, this oracular14 chant was only a single part of a set. Within half a year, Han Li and Zhang Tie had successfully comprehended15 the first layer of the cultivation chant, which Doctor Mo would be examining. If the two were able to overcome Doctor Mo’s expectations, then they could become Doctor Mo’s personal disciples and even share the same benefits as the Inner Disciples. Not to mention, Han Li had also heard from others that the treatment the Inner Disciples and Outer Disciples received was so vastly different that it spoke volumes of how enormous of a difference there was between the two. He then realized how ignorant16 he had been and cast away17 any thoughts of becoming an Inner Disciple. Han Li would be satisfied by just joining the Seven Mysteries Sect and receiving some silver to send back to his family. Everything else had seemed irrelevant18 because, above all else, he truly desired to help his poverty-stricken19 family. His only goal was to be able to take money home so he could provide his family with a better life. After learning Doctor Mo’s chant, Han Li had not once stopped cultivating. He spent every possible moment of day and night relentlessly20 practicing the chant. Because Doctor Mo hadn’t given them any pointers on how to cultivate, Han Li could only theorize by himself. After discussing with other young cultivators, he discovered they were using the Seven Mysteries Sect’s “Positive Yang Energy”, a self-meditated21 cultivation method. Relying on both the chant and the Positive Yang Energy, he cultivated assiduously22 for 3 months, but Han Li was shocked to realize that his progress was extremely slow! He had spent a great deal of effort and yet he was rewarded with one small thread of cool energy inside of his body. The energy was so infinitesimal23 that he could barely notice that it was there. If he hadn’t checked his body carefully for results, he would not have noticed the strand24 of energy. Could this be the rumored25 True Qi the instructors had talked about? Han Li suddenly came to this realization. The other disciples cultivating the Positive Yang Energy had told him that there was a distinct26 flow of warm energy and Qi being generated within their bodies. However, the thread of energy in Han Li’s body was extremely cold, completely opposite from the energy gained from cultivating Positive Yang Energy! Looking at the results, it was obvious Han Li was very far behind the other disciples. Those who used the True Qi from the Positive Yang Energy cultivation were able to punch a fist-sized hole27 through a small tree trunk and leap three meters into the air. Han Li, however, after circulating the strange Qi in his body, felt practically no different from his normal state. The only difference he could tell was that his spirit was more vigorous28 and his appetite29 was even more ravenous30 than before he came to the mountain. But what use was that? Seeing that the other children on the mountains were gaining ridiculous power, Han Li couldn’t help but feel dejected31. After realizing that he had barely made any progress, Han Li had nearly given up on his several months of hard work. He thought that with such a huge gap32 between himself and the others, he would not have a chance to catch up to the other children in the remaining amount of time before Doctor Mo’s test and successfully pass it. It would be better to plan for his trip back home instead. Incidentally, Han Li one day came across the cultivating Zhang Tie and realized something. Ever since Zhang Tie had started his cultivation with this mysterious oracular formula chant, his body showed no changes at all. There was no effect; not even a small amount of True Qi could be seen! Knowing that he had at least succeeded in forming one strand of True Qi, Han Li regained the confidence he had thrown away earlier. With the remaining amount of time, he furiously33 tried to cultivate the oracular chant. He worked even harder than before, training like a madman. Han Li began to use every single second to meditate and cultivate. Even when he was sleeping, he kept his body upright in a meditative position in hopes of having even a slight breakthrough. Of course, this intensive34 training method could not be maintained35 for longer than a few days. If he strained himself past his limit, his lack of sleep would make him unable to efficiently cultivate. What puzzled Han Li the most was that after Doctor Mo imparted36 the oracular chant to the two of them, he stopped interacting37 with them. Even their questions on cultivation had been ignored by him as if he did not even notice their existence. Every day, Doctor Mo would bring out the book with the three black characters written on the back cover and study it, staring intently38 as if the lines of text outlined the image of a beautiful woman and the cover was made of pure gold. At the beginning, Han Li and Zhang Tie thought that Doctor Mo no longer wanted to be a medical doctor but rather was studying bitterly to pass an imperial39 exam. After the two children learned to read, however, they recognized the three words on the back cover40, which read “Scripture of Longevity.” Doctor Mo was reading a book about how to cultivate oneself to the point of extending one’s lifespan. In that moment, the two children suddenly realized that Doctor Mo wasn’t trying to pass the imperial exam; he was trying to live thousands of years like a river turtle.

    <title><![CDATA[Nameless Oracular Formula]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F08%2F05%2FC-6%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[“Get up, get up.” A barely1 audible2 sound came from above Han Li, rousing him from his deep slumber. As soon as he opened his eyes, a huge face appeared in front of him. In shock, Han Li pushed himself backwards. Only then was he able to see that the owner of the face that had frightened him to death was the boy named Zhang Tie. “Hurry up and come eat something. After you’ve finished, we need to see Old Mo.” Zhang Tie passed some steaming white buns3 over to Han Li. “Where did you find this food?” Han Li stared blankly4 for a moment before accepting the buns. “At a kitchen near the valley, I saw a ton of5 people eating food, so I also grabbed a portion. After I had finished, I realized that you hadn’t eaten yet, so I grabbed two buns for you.” Zhang Tie smiled sincerely at Han Li. “Thank you very much, Brother Zhang.” Han Li was somewhat touched. Seeing that Zhang Tie looked quite a bit older than himself, he couldn’t help but blurt out the words “Brother Zhang.” “No…no problem. I’m too used to labor. If I’m idle6 even for just a moment, I always feel a bit….uncomfortable. If you ever need any help in the future, don’t hesitate to tell me. I have nothing else but strength.” Zhang Tie seemed to be somewhat embarrassed7, as he began to stammer8. Han Li hadn’t eaten breakfast or lunch and was somewhat starved9. In just a few bites, he devoured10 one bun. With just a bit more effort, both of the large buns completely disappeared into his stomach. “It’s getting late, we should go see Old Mo.” Han Li burped11 a few times and looked out the window towards the setting sun12. After mentally calculating the time, he decided that it was probably about time to go see Doctor Mo. Zhang Tie didn’t object, following Han Li to Doctor Mo’s house. There were rows of bookshelves along all four walls of Doctor Mo’s residence. These shelves13 were densely14 packed with various books. “Old Mo!” “Old Mo!” …… Doctor Mo’s back was tightly pressed against his chair as he was currently engrossed in15 reading the book in his hands. He didn’t seem to have noticed the two people’s arrival, nor had he heard their greetings. The two of them were still children after all, so when they saw Doctor Mo ignore them, they were at a loss on what to do, unsure of what would be the best course of action16. Thus, they could only stand to one side and wait. Finally, by the time Han Li’s feet had begun to turn numb17, Doctor Mo slowly placed his book down onto the table next to him. He coldly looked over at the two children and picked up his teacup to drink a few sips before slowly saying: “From this day on, you two will be accepted as my Unofficial Disciples. I will teach you some general knowledge on picking medicinal plants and refining medicines. I may also teach you two some life-saving healing techniques. But I will absolutely not teach you any martial arts.” Doctor Mo expressionlessly put down his teacup. “I will teach you two a set of body and spiritual cultivation chants. Although it won’t allow you to successfully subdue18 your enemy, it will strengthen your bodies. If you guys really want to learn some martial arts, you can go learn them from some other instructors. If you do so, I won’t object, but I’ll check your progression on this set of cultivation chants in half a year. If you don’t meet the standard, I’ll force you out to become an outer disciple. Do you two understand?” Doctor Mo’s tone suddenly became much more serious. It looked like he attached19 great importance to this set of chants. “We understand.” Han Li and Zhang Tie replied in unison. “You two should leave now. Come back tomorrow morning.” Doctor Mo waved his hands at the two of them, gesturing for them to go out. He then picked up his book and began reading it again. Before Han Li left, he couldn’t help but glance back at the book in Doctor Mo’s hands. It was a pity that he didn’t know how to read; he could only tell that the title was made up of three large, black characters. Unfortunately, Han Li didn’t recognize them. As soon as Han Li walked out of Doctor Mo’s residence, Han Li couldn’t help but let out the breath he had been holding. He didn’t know why, but just now, he hadn’t even dared to breathe in Doctor Mo’s presence. His mind had also been incredibly20 tensed. Now that he had left, he immediately loosened up21, returning to his normal state. During the following few days, Han Li’s excitement never faded22. He’d finally become a disciple of the Seven Mysteries Sect. Although he was still just an Unofficial Disciple, it was still better than the children that had been sent home. Even if he didn’t pass the test in half a year, he could still become an Outer Disciple like Third Uncle. In Han Li’s opinion, Third Uncle was a person of great status and position, so he didn’t concern himself over the examination in half a year. He even secretly hoped from the bottom of his heart that he wouldn’t pass. That way, he could leave the mountain earlier to see his parents and his most beloved younger sister. During the following few days, Doctor Mo would teach them some medicinal knowledge in the mornings. In the afternoons, he would make them study the body’s twelve main meridians23, energy channels, and acupoint24 locations. As for the little he taught them of martial arts, he made them maintain the horse stance25 and hit straw dummies26. A month later, the two of them were completely isolated27 from the other children. They no longer spent time learning anything else besides the chant. Ever since Doctor Mo had begun teaching them, they spent most of their time practicing the nameless chant. Doctor Mo strictly ordered them to not tell the chants to anyone else. If even a small segment28 was leaked29, Doctor Mo would harshly30 punish them and kick31 them out of his apprenticeship. During this period of time, Han Li began to have a better understand of the Seven Mysteries Sect and Doctor Mo. The Seven Mysteries Sect had a disciple named Wang Lu, who possessed the teachings32 handed down by the Sovereign Seven Supreme. Wang Lu became the Sect Leader of the Seven Mysteries Sect, and he split the sect with the help of the three other Sect Leaders. They divided the sect into two segments – the Inner and Outer Branch. The Outer Branch had a total of four divisions, namely the Flying Bird Division, Treasure Gathering Division, Four Seas Division, and External Blade Division. The Inner Branch also had four divisions, namely the Hundred Forge Division, Seven Supreme Division, Consecrated Division, and Blood Blade Division. In addition to the Inner and Outer Branch, there was a Council33 of Elders that reported to the Vice Sect Leaders and the Sect Leader. Doctor Mo was originally not a disciple of the Seven Mysteries Sect. A few years ago, Sect Leader Wang carelessly fell into an enemy’s trap34 while outside of the Celestial Rainbow Mountain and was heavily injured by the multiple attacks from the opposing party. As he wavered on the brink35 of death, his allies36 were unable to do anything about it. Just then, they happened to encounter37 Doctor Mo whose brilliant healing and effective medicines saved Sect Leader Wang’s life. Sect Leader Wang naturally couldn’t help but feel extremely grateful for Doctor Mo. He later found out that in addition to his profound38 medical expertise, Doctor Mo was a strong martial arts practitioner, which convinced Sect Leader Wang to invite Doctor Mo to join his sect. The elders carefully picked a small valley in the mountains to erect39 a residence specifically for Doctor Mo’s use in order to make the shift40 as comfortable as possible. The valley soon became a venerated41 place within the Seven Mysteries Sect thanks to Doctor Mo. Although none of the disciples had ever witnessed his skills, nor did they know how strong his martial arts was, Doctor Mo had used his brilliant medical expertise to save quite a few disciples’ lives. Thus, although he was normally expressionless and was a man of few words, he received a great amount of respect from the Inner Disciples. 1. 几乎不 &#8617; 2. 听得见的; &#8617; 3. 圆面包; &#8617; 4. 呆呆地 &#8617; 5. 大量的; 许多; &#8617; 6. 闲散的 &#8617; 7. 害羞的; &#8617; 8. 口吃; &#8617; 9. 饿死; &#8617; 10. 吞噬; &#8617; 11. 打嗝; &#8617; 12. 夕阳; &#8617; 13. 架子 &#8617; 14. 浓密地，稠密地 &#8617; 15. 全神贯注 &#8617; 16. 最佳行动方案 &#8617; 17. 麻木的; 失去知觉的; &#8617; 18. 制伏; 征服; &#8617; 19. 重视; &#8617; 20. 极端地; 极其; &#8617; 21. 放松 &#8617; 22. 衰退 &#8617; 23. 经络 &#8617; 24. 穴位; &#8617; 25. 站立姿势 &#8617; 26. 击中稻草假人 &#8617; 27. 脱离; &#8617; 28. 部分; 份; 片; 段; &#8617; 29. 漏; 渗漏; &#8617; 30. 严厉地； &#8617; 31. 踢; &#8617; 32. 拥有教义 &#8617; 33. 委员会; &#8617; 34. 陷阱 &#8617; 35. 危险的，或令人兴奋的处境的) 边缘 &#8617; 36. 盟友，支持者; &#8617; 37. 偶然碰到; 意外地遇见; 与…邂逅 &#8617; 38. 知识渊博的; 理解深刻的; &#8617; 39. 建立; 建造 &#8617; 40. 转移 &#8617; 41. 敬重; 崇敬; 敬仰; &#8617;]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[After a brief1 moment, Han Li felt a tightening sensation on his waist2 as his body grew light. His body was suddenly lifted upwards. Turning his head, Han Li saw the lanky senior helping him ascend the cliff. With one hand around Han Li’s waist, the senior disciple climbed up the cliff with nimble3 legs. Han Li could not help but notice that the sun had already reached the center of the skies. It was noon. “So I failed the test after all.” Han Li felt depression set in his heart. It seemed unfair. Even though he had desperately4 pushed forward, almost to the point of disregarding5 his life, why couldn’t he compare to the other children? In an instant6, the Bone Refining Cliff appeared before him. There were six other children resting on top of the cliff. Out of the six, only Wu Yan had the strength to have a conversation with a middle-aged old man wearing a dark blue garb. Division Head Yue as well as Protector Wang were also standing near him. They were waiting for the senior disciples to escort the rest of the children up the Bone Refining Cliff. After all the children had been escorted up the cliff, Division Head Yue stepped forward with a solemn7 expression on his face as he began to address8 the kids: “This time round, only seven of you passed. Out of this group, six will enter my Bai Duan Division and formally become our sect’s Inner Disciples.” Division Head Yue spoke slowly at the crowd of children. “As for Wu Yan, the first disciple to reach the top of the Bone Refining Cliff, he performed outstandingly and, as such9, will be directly sent to the Seven Supreme Division to learn the sect’s secret skills and martial arts.” After speaking, Division Head Yue glanced at the old man wearing the dark blue garb. The old man twirled10 his beard around one hand while nodding in satisfaction at Division Head Yue. “As for the others… ,” Division Head Yue contemplated11 the outcome of the remaining children for a moment before rubbing12 his chin13 and saying softly: “Zhang Tie and Han Li, although these two did not pass the test, they still performed admirably. Their determination will allow them to cope14 with the pain of practicing martial arts. The two of you will be Unofficial Disciples assigned15 to an instructor of our sect for the next half year. After half a year, you will be tested again. If you pass, you’ll be able to become Inner Disciples, but if you fail, you will be sent to join the Outer Disciples, helping the sect handle its external affairs.” Han Li stole a glance at the person named Zhang Tie. Like Han Li, Zhang Tie had begun climbing the rope but failed to reach the summit of the Bone Refining Cliff before midday. “Protector Wang, give the rest of the children some silver coins and send them back to their homes,” said Division Head Yue as he gave a cold stare at the children who failed the exam. “Understood!” Protector Wang complied16 with the order and he led the remainder of the children back down the cliff. “Zhang Jun, Wu Ming Rui, the two of you will assist me in sending the rest of these children to the Vice Division Head and Instructor Li.” Two senior disciples stepped forward and separated Han Li and the rest into two groups before leading them down the cliff. One of the senior disciples was the lanky senior that had always been behind Han Li. As they were descending the cliff, Han Li could not help but steal a glance at Wu Yan and discovered that he was still chatting with the old man in a dark blue robe, seemingly without any intent17 of moving from the spot. “He’s different from the rest of you. In the future, he will most likely be a core disciple. Only core disciples are sent to the Seven Supreme Division to train in the sect’s secret arts. Once he completes his training, at the very least, he will have the rank of a Protector.” The voice belonged to the long and thin face, who could tell what Han Li was thinking. From his tone, Han Li could hear undisguised18 hints19 of envy20 mixing with jealousy21. “Hmmph, isn’t Wu Yan just pulling strings22 and depending on his family’s connections? If it wasn’t for his older cousin being married to Sect Leader Ma, how could he be selected as a core disciple with such meager23 skill? He already surpassed the age limit but he was still sent to the Seven Supreme Division,” the senior said in a freezing tone that was comparable24 to a cold wind on a winter day. “Zhang Jun, have you gone mad25? How dare you gossip26 about the Sect Leader’s decisions? If this news was spread, both of us could suffer from cruel27 punishments and end up in dire straits28!” After hearing Zhang Jun’s words, the other senior with the long and thin face felt shock in his heart and rapidly checked his surroundings to make sure no one heard Zhang Jun. Only after discovering that there were no other disciples did he heave a sigh of relief29. The senior with the cold countenance30 snorted as if he were harboring hatred31 in his heart, but after Wu Ming Rui’s warning, he stopped talking. Only then did Han Li understand that the senior with the cold countenance was Zhang Jun. Listening to their conversation, Han Li could roughly32 understand what they were talking about. Wu Yan entered the Seven Supreme Division, not because of his own skills, but because he had the backing of the Sect Leader! As they walked along the mountain path, these two seniors both thought of the sect’s internal affairs, which filled them with sadness. Lacking the mood to converse, they silently led the children forward. The rest of the children also dared not speak out of turn; perhaps they were thinking of the differences between the Seven Mysteries Sect and their hometowns. Just as they were passing through a forested33 region, a sixty year-old man emerged34 from the woods. He was tall and thin with a yellow tinge35 to his skin and a head full of white hair. As he approached them, he coughed with every step, causing many of them to worry that he was suffering a great deal and could collapse36 at any moment. The senior disciples, upon seeing this old man, did not show a trace of37 worry on their faces. Instead, they respectfully greeted the old man with a bow. “Doctor Mo, this disciple greets you. Is there anything that you need this disciple to handle?” Zhang Jun, unlike his previously cold demeanor, now had an expression full of respect. To Zhang Jun, this old man in front of him was worthy of more respect than Division Head and even the Sect Leader. “Oh, is this the latest batch of disciples?” The old man continued coughing and asked with a hoarse38 voice. “Yes, among the eight of them, six are official Inner Disciples and two are Unofficial Disciples,” responded Zhang Jun. “Coincidentally39, I’m currently in need of some manpower, specifically an alchemy40 apprentice and an herb41 gatherer. Let these two follow me instead.” Doctor Mo randomly raise42 his finger and pointed, just as luck would have it, towards Han Li and Zhang Tie, the two Unofficial Disciples. “This disciple will obey your words. These two Unofficial Disciples actually caught eyes of the esteemed Doctor Mo, their karma43 must be exceptional…The two of you, why are you still standing there? Hurry and come to pay your respects to Doctor Mo. If you are able to learn a thing or two about the arts of healing44 from this esteemed elder, you will be extremely fortunate.” The two seniors had no traces of hesitation or objection on their face. The senior with the long and thin face, Wu Ming Rui, flattered45 Doctor Mo in order to curry favor with him. Han Li and Zhang Tie, upon seeing the two senior disciples’ sudden change of heart, had no objections. They could only accept in silence and follow the old man into the forest. Doctor Mo led the two of them down a small path that meandered46 through the forest. The path turned east and west before suddenly stopping in front of an entrance leading to a luscious47 green valley. On the left side of the valley was a courtyard used for farming48 medicinal herbs that emitted49 a fragrant50 smell into the air. After they entered the courtyard, Han Li spotted many herbs that were unknown to him. On the right side of the valley were lines of houses in various sizes. Looking in all four directions, Han Li saw no exit besides the gateway from which they entered. “This valley is called the God Hand Valley. Other disciples will not dare enter this valley unless they are suffering from injuries.” The old man stood in the middle of the line of houses and pointed to a smaller house. “For now, this will be your home. Rest and replenish51 your energy. When night falls, look for me in my house so I can inform you about several things.” “The two of you can call me Old Mo.” The old man huffed and considered for a moment before saying: “Doctor Mo is also acceptable.” After speaking, Doctor Mo ignored the two of them and slowly walked towards an impressive52 looking house, coughing with each step. Completely exhausted, Han Li did not bother to check with53 Zhang Tie before entering the house and selecting a bed to fall asleep on. He was satisfied, because, at this moment, he was halfway to becoming an Inner Disciple of the Seven Mysteries Sect. 1. 短时间的; 短暂的; &#8617; 2. 腰; 腰部; &#8617; 3. 灵活的; 敏捷的; &#8617; 4. 绝望地；不顾一切地，拼命地; &#8617; 5. 不理会; 不顾; 漠视; &#8617; 6. 立即的; 立刻的; &#8617; 7. 冷峻的; 表情严肃的; &#8617; 8. 演讲; 向…说话; &#8617; 9. 严格来说 &#8617; 10. 捻弄, 转动 &#8617; 11. 考虑; 思量; &#8617; 12. 擦; 磨; 搓; &#8617; 13. 颏; 下巴; &#8617; 14. 对付，处理; &#8617; 15. 分配(某物); 分派 &#8617; 16. 遵从; 服从; 顺从; &#8617; 17. 意图; 意向; &#8617; 18. 不加掩饰的; &#8617; 19. 暗示; 提示; 示意; 征兆; 迹象; &#8617; 20. 忌妒; &#8617; 21. 羡慕; &#8617; 22. 走内线;走关系 &#8617; 23. 贫瘠的 &#8617; 24. 类似的; &#8617; 25. 疯狂的; 猛烈的; &#8617; 26. 说三道四; &#8617; 27. 残酷的; &#8617; 28. 困境 &#8617; 29. 轻松; 解脱 &#8617; 30. 面容; 脸色; &#8617; 31. 窝藏仇恨 &#8617; 32. 大约; 大致; &#8617; 33. 满是森林的; &#8617; 34. 出现 &#8617; 35. 几分(颜色、感情或性质); &#8617; 36. 倒下，昏倒 &#8617; 37. 一丝; &#8617; 38. 嘶哑的; &#8617; 39. 巧得很; 凑巧; &#8617; 40. 炼金术 &#8617; 41. 药草; &#8617; 42. 提升; 举起; 提起; &#8617; 43. 善报; &#8617; 44. 治疗; &#8617; 45. 奉承; 讨好; &#8617; 46. 蜿蜒而行; 迂回曲折 &#8617; 47. 绚丽的; &#8617; 48. 务农; 种田 &#8617; 49. 发出，射出，散发(光、热、声音、气等); &#8617; 50. 香的; 芳香的; &#8617; 51. 补充; 重新装满; &#8617; 52. 令人赞叹的; &#8617; 53. 跟…联系; &#8617;]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Bone Refining Cliff]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F08%2F05%2FC-4%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[In front of the children, Division Head Yue hollered1, “Everyone, listen well. Inside the bamboo forest, there’s a small path on which you’ll proceed2 forward where you will eventually reach the Bone Refining Cliff3 of the Seven Mysteries Sect. The first area of the path will be the bamboo forest. The second area will be a rocky slope region. The last area will be the cliff. Only those who have managed to climb the Bone Refining Cliff by noon will be disciples of our Seven Mysteries Sect. If you finish after noon, although you won’t become an Inner Disciple, you can still become an Unofficial Disciple as long as your performance demonstrates4 remarkable5 prowess6.” Han Li naturally did not understand what it meant to be an Unofficial Disciple. He only knew that all he had to do was to climb the cliff. Casting7 his gaze8 forward at the uneven9, steep slope, he saw many lengthy bamboo shoots sprawled10 across the surface of the cliff. Seeing this, it seemed that the first obstacle should be pretty easy! Studying the other children, Han Li was unwilling to lose to those in his age group. The atmosphere quickly became tense11 for the other children as well. Division Head Yue cast a glance at the rising sun and said, “Okay, it’s almost time, prepare to set off! Don’t be afraid, your seniors will be protecting you from behind in case there’s any danger.” Han Li turned his head and glanced at those unrecognizable youths. These people were the senior disciples, so they should be from an earlier batch. Han Li could not help but think12, “How impressive13, if I managed14 to join them, could I wear the same robes15 of an Inner Disciple?” As he was blindly16 pondering17, Han Li discovered that the other children had already rushed into the bamboo forest. Seeing that he was left behind, Han Li quickly started moving forward. Once the thirty children rushed in, they stopped moving as a group and scattered18 within the spacious19 bamboo forest. Behind Han Li was a lanky20 senior disciple with a cold look on his face, silently following Han Li. Han Li was a bit fearful, but he did not dare to start a conversation and waste time. Slightly intimidated, he lowered his body and proceeded to tread21 on the steep slope. This stretch22 of bamboo forest looked ordinary on the outside, but after Han Li walked for a distance, he found that it was slowly becoming more and more difficult to move forward. His footsteps got heavier, and gradually, Han Li began to use one hand to pull the bamboo shoots, using the momentum23 of the bamboo springing24 back to its original position to propel25 him forward. Han Li persisted26 in this manner for quite some time, At a certain point27, he became extremely exhausted, so he had no choice but to find an empty space to sit down and rest, his breath leaving him in heavy bursts of air. After taking a breather, Han Li turned his gaze and saw the lanky senior behind him. Although the ground was very steep, this senior disciple was standing nonchalantly28 on the ground as if this was nothing to him. His body was totally devoid29 of dirt, standing erect30 like the bamboo shoots nearby, while he silently looked at Han Li in the distance. Looking at the cold glance of this senior, Han Li felt fear in his heart and rapidly turned his head back. He also heard sounds of heavy breathing in front and deduced31 that one of the faster children was also making use of this opportunity to rest. After a short break32, Han Li swiftly resumed his journey. The slope was perilously33 steep, and Han Li’s energy reserve34 got smaller and smaller. He decided to lie flat on the ground and claw his way forward instead of walking on his legs; such that if he exhausted his energy, he would not fall flat on his face. Luckily, his clothes were made of strong materials; if not, his limbs35 and knees might have been damaged by being dragged36 across the rocky ground. As he almost reached the end of the bamboo forest, Han Li felt that it was very tough to complete the last few steps. This was because as the stones and rocks on the ground increased, the number of bamboo shoots decreased. Han Li finally reached the point where there were no more bamboo shoots for him to use for support. Han Li slowly moved inch by inch past this last stretch of road and overcame the first obstacle. The moment he walked out of the bamboo forest, he could only see a vast expanse37 of land. In front of him was an incomparably38 huge, rocky mountain. On top of the gargantuan39 mountain were a few skinny kids, slowly climbing up the stone cliff along with a few senior disciples keeping a close watch on them. Han Li did not dare to hesitate40 any longer and rushed to make his way to the front of the huge rocky mountain. The mountain consisted of layers and layers of sedimentary41 rocks stacked42 upon each other and appeared very eroded43. In some places, the ground crumbled44 when touched. Of course, there were also solid45 slabs46 of broken stone47, but finding them was extremely perilous48 as they would lead to injury. Han Li had only practiced the most rudimentary49 of martial arts and as such, his hands were already filled with injuries after his trek50 through the bamboo forest. At the same time, his clothes were torn51 and tattered52 around his knees, and the flesh53 and muscles hidden by his clothing were also scraped54 and injured. Although the wound55 on his knee was small, Han Li gritted his teeth56 every time it came into contact with the jagged57 rocks; the pain almost more than he could bear. The few children in the lead had already climbed the furthest. Seeing the others ahead of him, Han Li refused to give up. The moment any thoughts of giving up flashed past his mind, images of his Third Uncle and his family would appear, giving him the motivation to carry on58. With the memories of those he loved urging59 him to continue, Han Li relentlessly60 proceeded forward. Before Han Li left for the Inner Disciple Examination, Han Li’s father and Third Uncle reminded Han Li that the test would be extremely tough. If he did not persevere61 to the end, Han Li would have no chances of joining the Seven Mysteries Sect. At this moment, Han Li no longer cared about joining the sect. Instead, the only source of motivation pushing him forward was an unwillingness to give in62 and the urgency63 to catch up to the others in the lead. Han Li raised64 his head and noticed that Wu Yan was currently in the lead. Wu Yan was older than Han Li and had even practiced martial arts; unsurprisingly, he had a stronger body compared to the others. Once again, Han Li turned his gaze backwards and saw that he had surpassed quite a few children, many of which were still rushing forward. Sucking in a deep breath, Han Li increased the speed of his ascent65. Despite exhausting the majority of his strength, he still hadn’t shortened the distance between him and those in the lead. As the unyielding sun climbed towards the center of the sky, Han Li’s body got heavier and heavier, making it harder for him to reach the summit66. In the meantime, Wu Yan had already reached the top of the huge mountain. Near the summit of the a hundred-meter-tall mountain was the incredibly steep Bone Refining Cliff. Over ten ropes67, each with knots68 the size of a fist69, hung from the top of the cliff. Wu Yan selected one and began to climb up the cliff. Han Li gazed over at Wu Yan, who was in the lead, and felt resigned70 in his heart. He knew that he could not catch up to those in front in the short amount of time left until noon. The notion of failing was quickly erased by the sudden pain that flared up71 from his injuries. The waves of fiery72 pain sapped the strength from his limbs. Feeling his body fall downward, Han Li frantically73 grasped a stone with one hand. His heart was beating erratically74 as he rapidly pasted his body onto the side of the mountain, not daring to make any sudden motions75. After a moment, he calmed down, using his hand to test the strength of the stone slab. Only after he determined76 it was secured in place did he manage to let go of his worries. Looking downwards, Han Li saw that the lanky senior was in a half-squatting77 position with his arms extended out, preparing to catch Han Li if he fell. Seeing that Han Li was safe, however, the senior retracted78 his arms. Han Li felt relief79 in his heart. If he really fell down the cliff, all of his efforts would have been wasted! After a short moment, he slowly inched80 forward and crawled towards the remaining81 ropes hanging down the Bone Refining cliff. Finally, he arrived at the bottom of a rope. The sun had almost reached the center of the sky, indicating82 that there was only one hour before the time limit was up. At this moment, Wu Yan had already ascended the cliff and he turned his head to gaze at the remaining children. Just as Han Li was climbing the rope, his gaze coincidentally83 met Wu Yan, only to see him giving a thumbs84 down gesture to the slower competitors. After laughing maniacally85, Wu Yan continued onward. With anger rising in his heart, Han Li grabbed ahold of the rope and began to climb. However, Han Li had long since used up all his energy. Currently, even holding the rope tightly was a challenge for him, let alone86 climbing the rope. Miraculously87, Han Li climbed up to the first knot88 on his rope. Sitting on it, he felt as if his body had turned into cotton89, unable to move a single finger. He turned his head and look at all the children behind him. Some of them had already given up, sitting down on the stone mountain and breathing heavily. Like Han Li, they had exhausted all of their strength and were on the verge of collapse90. Han Li could only bitterly91 smile; he had greatly underestimated92 this test. Fortunately, he wasn’t among the last of the children. After looking at the senior disciples’ cold gazes, he decided to carry on. Even though he had no chances of completing the test before noon, finishing late was better than hanging limp93 on a rope. Han Li extended both of his stiff94 hands and used the strength he had recovered during his break to slowly climb up the rope. But at this moment, Han Li’s hands stopped responding to his will; he even lacked the strength to maintain a grip95 on the rope. Han Li paused there and lingered96 for a moment before reluctantly97 deciding to remain there seated on the knot. 1. 叫喊; &#8617; 2. 继续做(或从事、进行); 接着做; 继而做; 行进; 前往; &#8617; 3. 练骨崖 &#8617; 4. 证明 &#8617; 5. 非凡的; 奇异的; 显著的; 引人注目的; &#8617; 6. 非凡的技能; 高超的技艺; 造诣; &#8617; 7. 投射 &#8617; 8. 凝视; 注视; &#8617; 9. 凹凸不平的; &#8617; 10. 蔓延; 杂乱无序地拓展; &#8617; 11. 神经紧张的; &#8617; 12. 忍不住想 &#8617; 13. 令人印象深刻 &#8617; 14. 勉励完成 &#8617; 15. 礼袍 &#8617; 16. 摸黑地; 在黑暗中; &#8617; 17. 琢磨; &#8617; 18. 散开; 四散; &#8617; 19. 宽敞的; &#8617; 20. 瘦长(或胳膊、腿细长) &#8617; 21. 踩; 踏; 践踏; 踩碎; 行走; 步行; 走; &#8617; 22. 片，段 &#8617; 23. 推进力; 动力; 动量; &#8617; 24. 跳; 跃; 弹 &#8617; 25. 推动; 驱动; 推进; &#8617; 26. 执著地做; 维持; &#8617; 27. 从某种程度来说 &#8617; 28. 冷淡地，漠不关心地; &#8617; 29. 完全没有; &#8617; 30. 垂直的; 竖直的; &#8617; 31. 推论; 推断; &#8617; 32. 短暂的休息 &#8617; 33. 危险地; &#8617; 34. 储备(量); 储藏(量) &#8617; 35. 肢; 臂; &#8617; 36. 拉，拽 &#8617; 37. 一大片，广阔，宽广 &#8617; 38. 相当，非常; &#8617; 39. 巨大的; 庞大的; &#8617; 40. 犹豫，迟疑不决; &#8617; 41. 沉积的; &#8617; 42. 放有成叠(或成摞、成堆)…的; &#8617; 43. 风化; &#8617; 44. 破碎，成碎屑; &#8617; 45. 固体的; 坚硬的; &#8617; 46. 厚板; 厚片; &#8617; 47. 碎石; 碎石土; &#8617; 48. 危险的; 艰险的; &#8617; 49. 基础的; 基本的; &#8617; 50. 长途跋涉; &#8617; 51. 撕裂; 撕碎; 扯破; &#8617; 52. 破烂的; 破旧的; &#8617; 53. 肉; (人体的) 皮肤 &#8617; 54. 擦伤; &#8617; 55. 伤，伤口; &#8617; 56. 咬着牙 &#8617; 57. 凹凸不平的; 有尖突的; &#8617; 58. 继续; 接着; 坚持; &#8617; 59. 敦促; 鞭策; &#8617; 60. 无情地; &#8617; 61. 坚持; 孜孜以求; &#8617; 62. 认输; 承认做不到; &#8617; 63. 紧急，迫切 &#8617; 64. 凸起的; 提高的; 升高的; &#8617; 65. 上升; 升高; 登高; &#8617; 66. 最高点; 顶点; 山顶; &#8617; 67. 粗绳; 线缆; 绳索; &#8617; 68. 结; &#8617; 69. 拳; 拳头; &#8617; 70. 逆来顺受的; 顺从的; &#8617; 71. 突然爆发; &#8617; 72. 火一般的; &#8617; 73. 疯狂似地 &#8617; 74. 不规则地; &#8617; 75. 移动; 动; &#8617; 76. 查明; 测定; &#8617; 77. 蹲;蹲坐;偷住 &#8617; 78. 撤销，收回 &#8617; 79. 宽慰，轻松; 解脱 &#8617; 80. 谨慎移动; &#8617; 81. 剩余; 遗留; &#8617; 82. 表明; 显示; 象征 &#8617; 83. 巧得很; 凑巧; &#8617; 84. 拇指; (手套的) 拇指部分 &#8617; 85. 疯狂地; &#8617; 86. 更别提 &#8617; 87. 神奇地；非凡地；出乎意料地; &#8617; 88. 结; 发髻; &#8617; 89. 棉，棉花(植株) &#8617; 90. 摇摇欲坠; &#8617; 91. 伤心地 &#8617; 92. 低估; 对…估计不足; &#8617; 93. 跛行; &#8617; 94. 硬的; 挺的; 僵硬的; 一动就疼的; &#8617; 95. 紧握; 紧抓; &#8617; 96. 继续存留; &#8617; 97. 勉强; 懊丧地; &#8617;]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The smell inside the carriage was unpleasant, but this could hardly be surprising. The optimal1 capacity2 for this carriage was only ten people, but currently there were about thirty young children squeezed3 into the carriage. Even if young children had smaller bodies than adults, the space inside the carriage was intolerably4 cramped5. The clever Han Li had chosen a seat near to the sides when he had first entered the carriage and was now stealthily6 observing the other children. The children who had registered or been nominated to take the test at the Seven Mysteries Sect could be segregated7 into three different groups based on their clothing and bearing. In the first group, there was a youth wearing silk8 clothing seated in the center of the carriage, surrounded by the majority of the children. This youth’s name was Wu Yan. He was 13 years old, one of the oldest children to be seated inside the carriage. Normally, he would not be even here since his age had already exceeded the age limit, but one of his older female cousins was married to someone of authority inside the Seven Mysteries Sect. Therefore, Wu Yan’s age was purposely overlooked9 and he was allowed to join the selection. Wu Yan’s family ran a martial arts dojo10, so he had access to a considerable11 amount of wealth. From a young age, he had practiced external martial arts. Even though his talent could not be considered excellent, when facing against Han Li’s type—those children who had never practiced martial arts before—it was more than enough for Wu Yan to trample12 them underfoot. It was very clear that children like Wu Yan, who came from powerful wealthy families and had previously practiced martial arts, could be considered the elite13 within the group of children inside the carriage. They were from different backgrounds: some came from the families of shopkeepers, some came from the families of workers, or families of craftsmen, etc. However, they all had one special thing in common; they grew up in the city. Thus, from an early age, they had learned from the elders of their families on how to observe people and know what was beneficial for them. Because of this, these people surrounded Wu Yan and repeatedly called out “Young Master Wu” and “Big Brother Wu” to curry favor14. Wu Yan seemed to be used to being fawned15 over. The third group of people were people like Han Li; this group came from remote and poor villages. They usually made do with what they had, were poor, and had suffered a life of hardship and strife16. Only five to six people belonged to this third group, creating a minority inside the carriage. They usually kept to themselves, and had a quiet demeanor, not even daring to speak or laugh loudly. They were a refreshing change17 when compared to those loud children. After the horse carriage exited Green Ox Town, it sped westward and made a few detours18 to visit other locations and collect even more children. On the fifth day, they managed to arrive at the Celestial Rainbow Mountain, the home of the Seven Mysteries Sect, near sundown. The first thing the children saw after exiting the carriage was the beautiful, captivating19 sunset. It was only when Protector Wang started to rally20 the children that they woke up from their daze21 and continued proceeding forward. Celestial Rainbow Mountain was originally Setting Wind Mountain. Legend has it that during ancient times, a five-coloured wind blew past this location, instantly transforming the mountain. After this place was discovered by humans, they realized how beautiful the sunset looked behind the rosy pink clouds. Inspired by the majestic22 image, the humans decided to rename this place Celestial Rainbow Mountain. The Celestial Rainbow Mountain was the second largest mountain in the Jing Province after the Bai Mang Mountain. It was extremely spacious, spanning23 a radius of ten Li. The Celestial Rainbow Mountain was actually a mountain range consisting of ten mountain peaks, each of them being incredibly24 dangerous, and under the control of the various divisions of the Seven Mysteries Sect. The main mountain peak of the Celestial Rainbow Mountain was named the “Setting Sun Summit”; it was treacherous25 and dangerous beyond comparison26. Not only was it extremely steep27, there was only a single path between the peak and base of the mountain. After the Seven Mysteries Sect rebuilt their roots in this area, they set up a total of thirteen checkpoints28 on the path up the mountain. Some of these checkpoints were hidden while others were out in the open. They were prepared for every single route that the Feral Wolf Gang might use to invade29 the mountain. As Han Li followed the escorts in front of the group, he surveyed his nearby surroundings. Suddenly, the escorts stopped as waves of friendly and amicable voices rang out. “Little Brother Wang, why did you arrive so late? You’re two days late.” “Division Head Yue, we were delayed by the journey here, sorry for causing you to worry.” Standing in front of all the children, Protector Wang replied respectfully as he bowed to a red-faced old man. Protector Wang’s stern30 facade31 was instantly replaced by a look of fawning. “Which batch of children is this?” “This is the batch number seventeen.” “En!” This Division Head Yue pompously looked towards Han Li and the other children. “Send them to the courtyard, let them rest for tonight. Tomorrow morning, we’ll begin the selection process. Send those who fail or break the rules back down the mountain.” “Understood, Division Head Yue.” Walking atop of the mountain’s stone steps32, the children were tremendously33 excited, but no one dared to speak loudly. Despite their young age, the children somehow34 knew that this place would determine their destiny. Protector Wang was in the lead and greeted several figures on the way to the children’s sleeping quarters35. It could be seen that he was familiar with a lot of people and was quite popular in the region. The majority of the people they met on their way were all wearing green clothes and equipped with a blade36 or sword. Even those that appeared empty-handed wore pouches full of mysterious items around their waists37. From their bearing38 and conduct39, one could tell that all of these people were somewhat40 proficient41 at martial arts. Han Li and the rest of the children were brought to a mountain peak that seemed lower in height in comparison to the other mountain peaks. On the summit, there was a house made of mud, built for the children to sleep in during the night. As he slept, Han Li dreamed that he was wearing silk, had a golden sword in his hands, and possessed42 peerless43 martial arts, soundly beating44 the village blacksmith’s sons who he previously were no match for. Then he woke on second morning, still reminiscent45 of his dream. Protector Wang did not let the children enjoy breakfast. Instead, he brought all of the children down the mountain to a steep slope46 containing many bamboo47.

    <title><![CDATA[Green Ox Village]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F08%2F05%2FC-2%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Han Li’s home was said to be a small city, but it was actually just a large village called Green Ox Village. Only those who lived in the mountainous region1 and the natives with no knowledge of the outside world called the village Green Ox City. The only reason why Han Li knew about this was because he had been informed by his Uncle Zhang, who had been working as a gatekeeper for more than ten years. Green Ox Village wasn’t very large2. It only had one main road, known as Green Ox Street, which spanned3 from the eastern to the western borders of the village. There was also only one tavern4 in village, located on its western border. For any traveling merchant that didn’t want to sleep outdoors, this tavern was the only option. There was only one road for carriages in the western part of Green Ox Village. It ran from the gates of the village and the Green Ox Tavern all the way to the Spring Fragrance Restaurant, the only other place anyone would visit besides the tavern. Spring Fragrance Restaurant wasn’t big by any means5 and was actually quite old-fashioned. However, this establishment6 had a certain charm7 that was appealing to many travelers. Every day at noon, there would always be a crowd of people, making the place constantly swamped8. A bearded9 man with a round face emerged10 from a carriage along with a dark skinned, rotund little boy who looked to be around ten years old. They both walked into the restaurant with a swagger11. All of the regular customers knew who this man was. He was the manager of this restaurant, “Fatty Han.” The boy, however, was not someone they were familiar with. “Elder Han, this tanned little boy resembles12 you a lot. Could it be a child from a prostitute13 you spent the night with?” someone joked. The moment the joke was uttered14, the entire restaurant roared15 with laughter. “Peh! This is the son of my blood brother, my own nephew! Of course he’ll look like me,” Fatty Han said proudly instead of being angered. This duo16 had traveled for three whole days without rest before arriving at the village. They were Han Li and his Third Uncle, who was known as “Fatty Han” by the villagespeople. Fatty Han greeted a few regulars before bringing Han Li to the back of the restaurant, and entered a remote courtyard. “Xiao Li, you should rest here for a while. When the time comes for the Inner Disciple Examinations, I’ll call you. For now, I must leave in order to attend to a few regulars17.” Fatty Han pointed at a side room in the courtyard and kindly motioned18 for Han Li to enter it. (TL: “Xiao” in this context means “little”) After saying that, Han Li’s Third Uncle turned around and hurried back inside the restaurant to tend19 to his customers. As he reached the door, he felt a sudden unease in his heart and reminded Han Li, “Don’t run about20. You might get lost in the village if you wander around. So it’s best if you don’t leave this courtyard.” “En!” Hearing Han Li’s honest response, he nodded in relief21 and walked out the door. After his Third Uncle left the courtyard, Han Li suddenly felt exhausted. The moment his head landed on his pillow, he fell into a deep sleep and began snoring, surprisingly without the fear of a normal kid staying alone in unfamiliar surroundings. When the night came, a servant22 came by with some food. Although it wasn’t a lavish23 meal, it was still delicious. After Han Li ate the food, the servant was clearing away the remaining dishes when his Third Uncle leisurely24 walked in. “How was it? Was the meal suitable to your taste? Do you miss home?” “Yes, I miss home…” Han Li replied in his childish voice. Third Uncle seemed satisfied with Han Li’s response. He began to talk to him about his daily life and bragged25 about many of his experiences. Gradually, Han Li became less shy and started to laugh and talk with his Third Uncle. In this manner, two days quickly passed. On the third day, after Han Li finished dinner, he was waiting for his uncle’s stories of Jiang Hu when a carriage stopped in front of the restaurant door. This carriage was painted a shiny26 black color and even the horse was a rarely seen golden steed27. But what attracted the most attention was that on the frame of the carriage was the word “Mystery” written in silver characters in the middle of a red triangle emblazing a black banner28. The image on the banner also emitted an unfathomable29 air. Seeing this banner, every martial arts expert in the area knew that this carriage belonged to one of the two local overlords30 in the area, the Seven Mysteries Sect. It seemed that an esteemed31 guest had arrived in Green Ox Village. The Seven Mysteries Sect was previously known as the Seven Supreme Sect. Two hundred years ago, the sect was established by an extremely famous martial master named “Sovereign of the Seven Supreme”. Having once swept across32 and dominated33 the Jing Province and the nearby several Provinces for a few decades, the Sovereign of the Seven Supreme was resoundingly34 famous. But after he was died with illness, the power of the Seven Mysteries Sect took a devastating hit35 and its influence dropped drastically. In the end, the Seven Mysteries Sect was forced out of the main city of the Jing Province by the combined efforts of its rival36 sects. A hundred years ago, the sect was forced to relocate37 to an extremely remote area called the Celestial Rainbow Mountain. From then on, they rebuilt their roots in that third rate region and became a local powerhouse. Locally, the only other power that could rival the Seven Mysteries Sect was the Feral Wolf Gang. The Feral Wolf Gang was originally a gang38 of horse-mounted39 bandits40 from the Jing Province that had no qualms41 about burning, killing, looting42 and pillaging. After a while, an army dispatched43 by the imperial44 court encircled and fiercely suppressed45 the bandits. Some of the bandits accepted the amnesty granted46 to them by the imperial court while the remaining bandits reformed themselves into the Feral Wolf Gang. The Feral Wolf Gang was exceedingly cruel47 and bloodthirsty, retaining their former characteristics of having no qualms about committing atrocities48. Thus, whenever they clashed49, the Seven Mysteries Sect was always at a disadvantage. Even though the Feral Wolf Gang controlled more villages than the Seven Mysteries Sect, the gang didn’t know how to manage the villages effectively to run businesses and generate income. In comparison, the wealth of the villages controlled by the Seven Mysteries Sect vastly outstripped50 the villages under Feral Wolf Gang’s control. Jealous51 of the Seven Mysteries Sect’s prosperity52, the Feral Wolf Gang made plans to take over the Sect’s territory53, resulting in the longstanding54 conflict between the two major powers. The conflict gave the current Sect Leader of the Seven Mysteries Sect endless headaches. Because of the Feral Wolf Gang, the Seven Mysteries Sect have been accepting an increasing number of disciples in recent years. After the carriage stopped, a skinny55 forty year-old man jumped down. His movements were extremely nimble56, indicating57 that he was a powerful expert. He seemed to be very familiar with Fatty Han’s restaurant and walked pompously58 towards the room Han Li was residing in. Upon seeing the forty year-old man, Fatty Han immediately greeted him respectfully. “Protector Wang, why has an esteemed person such as yourself personally made the trip?” “Humph!” Protector Wang coldly snorted60. “The roads here haven’t been peaceful lately. Because of this, there’s a need to strengthen the defenses. Thus, the elders ordered that I personally come. Don’t speak any more rubbish. Is this the child you wanted to nominate61?” “Yes, yes, this is my nephew. I hope that Protector Wang will take care of him.” Looking at the impatient look on Protector Wang face, Third Uncle immediately retrieved62 a heavy-looking pouch and secretly passed it over to Protector Wang. After he assessed63 the weight of the pouch, Protector Wang’s impatient demeanor64 visibly relaxed. “Fatty Han, you truly know how to conduct yourself65! On the way back, I will make sure that all of your nephew’s needs are well cared for. Anyways, it is getting pretty late now. We had best hurry on our way.” 1. 区域，地区 &#8617; 2. 的确不大 &#8617; 3. 横跨; 跨越; &#8617; 4. 酒馆; 小旅店; 客栈; &#8617; 5. 无论如何 &#8617; 6. 旅馆 &#8617; 7. 魅力 &#8617; 8. 应接不暇 &#8617; 9. 留胡子的;有胡须的 &#8617; 10. 出现，浮现 &#8617; 11. 神气十足;大摇大摆 &#8617; 12. 看起来像 &#8617; 13. 妓女 &#8617; 14. 说;讲 &#8617; 15. 放声大笑 &#8617; 16. 二人组 &#8617; 17. 照顾一些常客 &#8617; 18. 做动作，示意 &#8617; 19. 走向 &#8617; 20. 到处乱跑 &#8617; 21. 放心地点点头 &#8617; 22. 仆人 &#8617; 23. 耗资巨大的 &#8617; 24. 从容不迫地，慢慢地，悠闲地 &#8617; 25. 吹嘘 &#8617; 26. 光亮的;锃亮的 &#8617; 27. 骏马 &#8617; 28. 横幅 &#8617; 29. 难以理解的;莫测高深的 &#8617; 30. 领主，大王 &#8617; 31. 受尊敬的;受敬重的;受仰慕的 &#8617; 32. 横扫 &#8617; 33. 支配;控制 &#8617; 34. 令人瞩目地 &#8617; 35. 毁灭性的打击 &#8617; 36. 竞争对手 &#8617; 37.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[“Second Fool” opened his eyes and stared at the mud and thatch roof over his head. The quilt covering his body was a deep yellow color and had a musty smell. It was so old that its original color could no longer be distinguished. Next to him lay his second brother, Han Zhu, who appeared to be in a deep slumber. Snores intermittently floated over as he slept. Five feet from the bed was an earthen1 wall that had suffered from numerous cracks due to the passage of time. From the other side of the wall came the nagging2 voice of his mother and the occasional deep breathing of his father who was smoking his pipe. Second Fool slowly closed his eyes, trying to force himself to sleep. He knew that if he didn’t go to sleep now, he wouldn’t be able to wake up early the next day. If he woke up late, he would not be able to go up to the mountains with his good friends to gather firewood3. Second Fool’s real name was Han Li. This elegant4 name was not given to him by his parents. When he was born, his parents had offered two pieces of cornbread to the village’s Elder Zhang in exchange for giving the baby Han Li a second name. When Uncle Zhang was young, he had attended school with the wealthy children in the city. As he was the only one in the village who knew how to read a few words, more than half of the children in the village were named by him. Han Li was called “Second Fool” by those in the village. Despite his name, he wasn’t stupid looking or foolish. On the contrary, he was actually the smartest person in the village. But just like the other children, aside from5 when they were home, nobody called him by his official name “Han Li”. Instead, they called him by his pet name “Second Fool”. The reason why he was nicknamed “Second Fool” was due to the fact that there was already someone named “Fool” in the village. This type of nickname was nothing. There were children in the village named “Doggy” and “Dumb Egg”. These names weren’t nearly as6 pleasant-sounding as “Second Fool”. Because of this, Han Li felt some consolation7 even though he was not very fond of his nickname. Physically, Han Li was very ordinary. He was tan8 and matched the generic descriptions of a child born in a farming community. Deep in his heart however, he had matured9 faster than others of the same age. Ever since he was young, he had yearned10 that one day, he would be able to leave his small village and explore the fertile lands of the outside world that Uncle Zhang had always talked about. Han Li had never dared to speak of his dreams to anyone else in the village because they would be deeply shocked. After all, leaving this place was a notion11 that even adults didn’t easily think about, let alone12 a small child. Children around his age only knew how to chase chickens and pet dogs. They had never entertained the strange notion of leaving the village. Han Li’s family had a total of seven members, including two older brothers, one older sister and one younger sister. He was the fourth eldest in his family and turned ten this year. Together, they lived a hard yet honest lifestyle. Very rarely did they get to eat meat and fish, but the entire family was content with13 living with the meager14 resources they had. At this moment, Han Li was hovering between the state of sleep and consciousness. As he slowly drifted to sleep, only one thought was on his mind. While in the mountains, he had to pick more red berries for his younger sister whom he doted on the most! The next morning, at noon, Han Li was shielding himself from the scorching sun overhead in the shade casted by the pile of lumber on his back. Wrapped around his chest was a pouch filled to the brim with red berries that bounced with each step as he walked home. He had no idea that at this moment, there was a guest in his home, a guest that would change his destiny forever. This guest was actually someone who had very close blood ties with Han Li. It was his Third Uncle! It was rumored that his Third Uncle was the shopkeeper of a restaurant in the nearby city. According to his parents, Third Uncle was the most capable within their family. After a few hundred years, the Han family had finally produced someone like his Third Uncle, a figure with status15 and respect that was unrivaled within the family. When Han Li was young, he had only met his Third Uncle a few times. Han Li’s older brother became a blacksmith16’s apprentice17 in the city thanks to Third Uncle’s introduction. Every so often18, this Third Uncle would even gift some food to his parents to bring home and eat. Because he had looked after Han Li’s family with great consideration, Han Li had a very good impression of him. Even though his parents never said anything, he knew that in their hearts, they were very grateful. Han Li’s eldest brother was the family’s pride and joy. As an apprentice of a blacksmith, he was able to bring home 30 copper coins every month, minus19 living expenses. And when he finally graduated from his apprenticeship20, he would earn even more money! Every time his parents talked about their eldest son, their spirits would soar with pride. Although Han Li was young, he was tremendously21 envious22. The best work he could find was to be the apprentice of a craft master and rely on the crafts he made to earn money. So when Han Li saw the brand new satin robes and the round face that belonged to his Third Uncle, Han Li was overjoyed. Setting down the firewood in a corner outside of the house, he went to the front of the house to greet his Third Uncle. “Third Uncle, Han Li greets you.” After doing so, he obediently23 stood by the side and listened to his Third Uncle chat with his parents. Third Uncle beamed24 at Han Li as he opened his mouth, praising his nephew25. “What a sensible child!” After complimenting26 Han Li, he turned his attention back to Han Li’s parents and explained the reason for his visit. Although Han Li wasn’t able to fully understand the words his Third Uncle was saying as he was too young, he still roughly understood what he said. It turned out his Third Uncle’s restaurant had the backing of the Seven Mysteries Sect27. This sect was divided into the inner and outer divisions. Not too long ago, Third Uncle had been officially recognized as an outer disciple28. That meant that he could bring a child between the ages of 7 and 12 to take the Inner Disciple Examinations. Once every 5 years, the Seven Mysteries Sect would formally issue29 invitations for youngsters to take the test to become Inner Disciples. The test would officially begin the following month. Third Uncle was a smart and astute man who was childless, so he naturally thought of Han Li who met the age requirement. The moment the usually docile30 Father Han heard the words “Jiang Hu” and “Sect”, along with many other phrases he had never heard before, he felt very hesitant31. Bringing his smoking pipe to his lips and giving it a puff32, he sat down without saying a word. (TL: “Father Han” is the title of Han Li’s father) According to Third Uncle, the Seven Mysteries Sect could be considered one of the best sects within several hundred miles. If one were to become an Inner Disciple, not only would one be able to practice martial arts for free, one would also receive a monthly allowance31 and have his needs taken care of. Not only that, those who didn’t pass the Inner Disciple Examinations could still enter the sect’s outer division and become an outer disciple like Third Uncle. They would still have the opportunity to help the Seven Mysteries Sect handle its external affairs. Upon hearing the possibility that his son could receive a monthly allowance and even become as successful as his Third Uncle, Han Li’s father finally decided to give his approval. After getting the approval from Han Li’s father, Third Uncle felt elation32 in his heart. Leaving behind two silver coins, he said that he would return in a month to escort33 Han Li to the testing area. During this period of time, Han Li’s father had to ensure that Han Li was clothed and well fed to improve his constitution34 so that it would be easier for Han Li to pass the test. After giving these instructions35, Third Uncle bid36 farewell37 to Han Li and his father, patted38 Han Li on his head and left for the city. While Han Li didn’t fully comprehend his Third Uncle’s words, he could understand that he would be able to earn money in the big city. It seemed that his dream from before was going to come true, making him so excited that he could not sleep for the first few nights. After one month had passed, Third Uncle returned to the village, escorting Han Li to the testing site. Before he left, Han Li’s father repeatedly instructed Han Li on the ways of proper39 behavior. One must be honest, have the capacity to endure, and avoid unnecessary conflicts with others. Meanwhile, Han Li’s mother urged40 him to take care of his health and to eat and sleep well. The day finally arrived and Third Uncle came to take Han Li away by carriage41. As his parents gradually disappeared from his sight, Han Li bit down on his lips in order to prevent his tears from flowing down his eyes. Although he had always been more mature than other children of the same age, he was still a ten year-old child. This was the first time he had left home, so he naturally felt depressed. A homesickness developed in his heart. He was determined to rush home after he struck rich, never to be separated from his parents. Han Li would never have thought that from this moment on, money would lose any meaning to him. He was unexpectedly going to walk a path different from ordinary mortals42. Instead, he was going to walk down his own path towards Immortal43 Cultivation! 1. 泥做的 &#8617; 2. 唠叨 &#8617; 3. 柴 &#8617; 4. 优雅的 &#8617; 5. 除了 &#8617; 6. 远不及 &#8617; 7. 安慰 &#8617; 8. 棕褐色的; 棕黄色的 &#8617; 9. 成熟 &#8617; 10. 渴望 &#8617; 11. 观念; 信念; 理解 &#8617; 12. 更别提，更不用说 &#8617; 13. 满足于 &#8617; 14. 贫瘠的；不毛的；瘦的 &#8617; 15. 地位; 身份; 职位 &#8617; 16. 铁匠 &#8617; 17. 学徒 &#8617; 18. 时长; 不时地 &#8617; 19. 减;减去 &#8617; 20. 学徒期 &#8617; 21. 极大地 &#8617; 22. 羡慕的;忌妒的 &#8617; 23. 服从地，顺从地，忠顺地 &#8617; 24. 笑容满面;眉开眼笑;发射(电波);射出光(或热) &#8617; 25. 侄子;外甥 &#8617; 26. 赞美;称赞;钦佩 &#8617; 27. 教派;宗派;异端;派系 &#8617; 28. 信徒;门徒; &#8617; 29. 宣布;公布;发出 &#8617; 30. 驯服的;易驾驭的;易控制的 &#8617; 31. 津贴 &#8617; 32. 兴高采烈 &#8617; 33. 护卫;护送 &#8617; 34. 宪法;章程;身体素质;构造 &#8617; 35. 操作指南;命令;吩咐 &#8617; 36. 问候、道别等;吩咐 &#8617; 37. 告别;辞行 &#8617; 38.
