    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The Village by the Forest“Second Fool” opened his eyes and stared at the mud and thatch roof over his head. The quilt covering his body was a deep yellow color and had a musty smell. It was so old that its original color could no longer be distinguished. Next to him lay his second brother, Han Zhu, who appeared to be in a deep slumber. Snores intermittently floated over as he slept. Five feet from the bed was an earthen1 wall that had suffered from numerous cracks due to the passage of time. From the other side of the wall came the nagging2 voice of his mother and the occasional deep breathing of his father who was smoking his pipe. Second Fool slowly closed his eyes, trying to force himself to sleep. He knew that if he didn’t go to sleep now, he wouldn’t be able to wake up early the next day. If he woke up late, he would not be able to go up to the mountains with his good friends to gather firewood3. Second Fool’s real name was Han Li. This elegant4 name was not given to him by his parents. When he was born, his parents had offered two pieces of cornbread to the village’s Elder Zhang in exchange for giving the baby Han Li a second name. When Uncle Zhang was young, he had attended school with the wealthy children in the city. As he was the only one in the village who knew how to read a few words, more than half of the children in the village were named by him. Han Li was called “Second Fool” by those in the village. Despite his name, he wasn’t stupid looking or foolish. On the contrary, he was actually the smartest person in the village. But just like the other children, aside from5 when they were home, nobody called him by his official name “Han Li”. Instead, they called him by his pet name “Second Fool”. The reason why he was nicknamed “Second Fool” was due to the fact that there was already someone named “Fool” in the village. This type of nickname was nothing. There were children in the village named “Doggy” and “Dumb Egg”. These names weren’t nearly as6 pleasant-sounding as “Second Fool”. Because of this, Han Li felt some consolation7 even though he was not very fond of his nickname. Physically, Han Li was very ordinary. He was tan8 and matched the generic descriptions of a child born in a farming community. Deep in his heart however, he had matured9 faster than others of the same age. Ever since he was young, he had yearned10 that one day, he would be able to leave his small village and explore the fertile lands of the outside world that Uncle Zhang had always talked about. Han Li had never dared to speak of his dreams to anyone else in the village because they would be deeply shocked. After all, leaving this place was a notion11 that even adults didn’t easily think about, let alone12 a small child. Children around his age only knew how to chase chickens and pet dogs. They had never entertained the strange notion of leaving the village. Han Li’s family had a total of seven members, including two older brothers, one older sister and one younger sister. He was the fourth eldest in his family and turned ten this year. Together, they lived a hard yet honest lifestyle. Very rarely did they get to eat meat and fish, but the entire family was content with13 living with the meager14 resources they had. At this moment, Han Li was hovering between the state of sleep and consciousness. As he slowly drifted to sleep, only one thought was on his mind. While in the mountains, he had to pick more red berries for his younger sister whom he doted on the most! The next morning, at noon, Han Li was shielding himself from the scorching sun overhead in the shade casted by the pile of lumber on his back. Wrapped around his chest was a pouch filled to the brim with red berries that bounced with each step as he walked home. He had no idea that at this moment, there was a guest in his home, a guest that would change his destiny forever. This guest was actually someone who had very close blood ties with Han Li. It was his Third Uncle! It was rumored that his Third Uncle was the shopkeeper of a restaurant in the nearby city. According to his parents, Third Uncle was the most capable within their family. After a few hundred years, the Han family had finally produced someone like his Third Uncle, a figure with status15 and respect that was unrivaled within the family. When Han Li was young, he had only met his Third Uncle a few times. Han Li’s older brother became a blacksmith16’s apprentice17 in the city thanks to Third Uncle’s introduction. Every so often18, this Third Uncle would even gift some food to his parents to bring home and eat. Because he had looked after Han Li’s family with great consideration, Han Li had a very good impression of him. Even though his parents never said anything, he knew that in their hearts, they were very grateful. Han Li’s eldest brother was the family’s pride and joy. As an apprentice of a blacksmith, he was able to bring home 30 copper coins every month, minus19 living expenses. And when he finally graduated from his apprenticeship20, he would earn even more money! Every time his parents talked about their eldest son, their spirits would soar with pride. Although Han Li was young, he was tremendously21 envious22. The best work he could find was to be the apprentice of a craft master and rely on the crafts he made to earn money. So when Han Li saw the brand new satin robes and the round face that belonged to his Third Uncle, Han Li was overjoyed. Setting down the firewood in a corner outside of the house, he went to the front of the house to greet his Third Uncle. “Third Uncle, Han Li greets you.” After doing so, he obediently23 stood by the side and listened to his Third Uncle chat with his parents. Third Uncle beamed24 at Han Li as he opened his mouth, praising his nephew25. “What a sensible child!” After complimenting26 Han Li, he turned his attention back to Han Li’s parents and explained the reason for his visit. Although Han Li wasn’t able to fully understand the words his Third Uncle was saying as he was too young, he still roughly understood what he said. It turned out his Third Uncle’s restaurant had the backing of the Seven Mysteries Sect27. This sect was divided into the inner and outer divisions. Not too long ago, Third Uncle had been officially recognized as an outer disciple28. That meant that he could bring a child between the ages of 7 and 12 to take the Inner Disciple Examinations. Once every 5 years, the Seven Mysteries Sect would formally issue29 invitations for youngsters to take the test to become Inner Disciples. The test would officially begin the following month. Third Uncle was a smart and astute man who was childless, so he naturally thought of Han Li who met the age requirement. The moment the usually docile30 Father Han heard the words “Jiang Hu” and “Sect”, along with many other phrases he had never heard before, he felt very hesitant31. Bringing his smoking pipe to his lips and giving it a puff32, he sat down without saying a word. (TL: “Father Han” is the title of Han Li’s father) According to Third Uncle, the Seven Mysteries Sect could be considered one of the best sects within several hundred miles. If one were to become an Inner Disciple, not only would one be able to practice martial arts for free, one would also receive a monthly allowance31 and have his needs taken care of. Not only that, those who didn’t pass the Inner Disciple Examinations could still enter the sect’s outer division and become an outer disciple like Third Uncle. They would still have the opportunity to help the Seven Mysteries Sect handle its external affairs. Upon hearing the possibility that his son could receive a monthly allowance and even become as successful as his Third Uncle, Han Li’s father finally decided to give his approval. After getting the approval from Han Li’s father, Third Uncle felt elation32 in his heart. Leaving behind two silver coins, he said that he would return in a month to escort33 Han Li to the testing area. During this period of time, Han Li’s father had to ensure that Han Li was clothed and well fed to improve his constitution34 so that it would be easier for Han Li to pass the test. After giving these instructions35, Third Uncle bid36 farewell37 to Han Li and his father, patted38 Han Li on his head and left for the city. While Han Li didn’t fully comprehend his Third Uncle’s words, he could understand that he would be able to earn money in the big city. It seemed that his dream from before was going to come true, making him so excited that he could not sleep for the first few nights. After one month had passed, Third Uncle returned to the village, escorting Han Li to the testing site. Before he left, Han Li’s father repeatedly instructed Han Li on the ways of proper39 behavior. One must be honest, have the capacity to endure, and avoid unnecessary conflicts with others. Meanwhile, Han Li’s mother urged40 him to take care of his health and to eat and sleep well. The day finally arrived and Third Uncle came to take Han Li away by carriage41. As his parents gradually disappeared from his sight, Han Li bit down on his lips in order to prevent his tears from flowing down his eyes. Although he had always been more mature than other children of the same age, he was still a ten year-old child. This was the first time he had left home, so he naturally felt depressed. A homesickness developed in his heart. He was determined to rush home after he struck rich, never to be separated from his parents. Han Li would never have thought that from this moment on, money would lose any meaning to him. He was unexpectedly going to walk a path different from ordinary mortals42. Instead, he was going to walk down his own path towards Immortal43 Cultivation! 1. 泥做的 &#8617; 2. 唠叨 &#8617; 3. 柴 &#8617; 4. 优雅的 &#8617; 5. 除了 &#8617; 6. 远不及 &#8617; 7. 安慰 &#8617; 8. 棕褐色的; 棕黄色的 &#8617; 9. 成熟 &#8617; 10. 渴望 &#8617; 11. 观念; 信念; 理解 &#8617; 12. 更别提，更不用说 &#8617; 13. 满足于 &#8617; 14. 贫瘠的；不毛的；瘦的 &#8617; 15. 地位; 身份; 职位 &#8617; 16. 铁匠 &#8617; 17. 学徒 &#8617; 18. 时长; 不时地 &#8617; 19. 减;减去 &#8617; 20. 学徒期 &#8617; 21. 极大地 &#8617; 22. 羡慕的;忌妒的 &#8617; 23. 服从地，顺从地，忠顺地 &#8617; 24. 笑容满面;眉开眼笑;发射(电波);射出光(或热) &#8617; 25. 侄子;外甥 &#8617; 26. 赞美;称赞;钦佩 &#8617; 27. 教派;宗派;异端;派系 &#8617; 28. 信徒;门徒; &#8617; 29. 宣布;公布;发出 &#8617; 30. 驯服的;易驾驭的;易控制的 &#8617; 31. 津贴 &#8617; 32. 兴高采烈 &#8617; 33. 护卫;护送 &#8617; 34. 宪法;章程;身体素质;构造 &#8617; 35. 操作指南;命令;吩咐 &#8617; 36. 问候、道别等;吩咐 &#8617; 37. 告别;辞行 &#8617; 38.
